## Password-Protected Page Access

### Introduction

This feature allows users to access a different page on the website if the password they enter matches the one specified on the server. This is useful for protecting sensitive or restricted content.

### How It Works

1. **Password Verification:** When a user attempts to access the protected page, they are prompted to enter a password.
2. **Server-Side Check:** The password entered by the user is compared to the password stored on the server.
3. **Access Granted:** If the passwords match, the user is redirected to the specified page.
4. **Access Denied:** If the passwords do not match, the user remains on the current page or is shown an error message.
